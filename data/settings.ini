## This ensures that the gtk3-classic-module gets loaded.  You can add other
## modules to the list here, though you may prefer to add them to your
## GTK_MODULES environment variable instead.

## Comment out the following statement if you want mnemonics (indicated by
## underlining beneath text on buttons and menu items) to be displayed only
## while the <Alt> key is being held down.  Keep this uncommented if you want
## mnemonics to be displayed at all times.

gtk-auto-mnemonics = 0


## Comment out one or both of the following if you do not want buttons and/or
## menu items (respectively) to display icons next to the button/menu item
## text, presuming there is an icon to display.
##
## NOTE:  Some desktop environments may override these settings and provide
##        the settings in their own desktop preferences configuration tool(s);
##        please check your desktop environment's appearance preferences first.

## Set this to your preferred set of stock icon sizes.  The default here is to
## use 16x16 pixel icons for menus, 16x16 pixel icons for small toolbars,
## 24x24 pixel icons for large toolbars, 24x24 pixel icons for buttons, 32x32
## pixel icons for the icons displayed to represent dragged content during a
## drag-and-drop operation, and 48x48 pixel icons for dialog icons.  Feel free
## to change any of these values as you desire.

## This statement ensures that scrollbars are always displayed, rather than
## disappearing until you are about to use them.  Setting the environment
## variable GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0 has the same effect.
##
## NOTE:  Some desktop environments may override this setting, instead
##        providing the setting in their own desktop preferences configuration
##        tool(s); please check your desktop environment's appearance
##        preferences first.

## This setting was not available before GTK 3.24.9; if your version of GTK is
## more than a few years old, you may need to comment this out and set
## GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0 instead.

## Change this to whatever your preferred document viewer program is;
## this command will be run when you click 'Print Preview' in an application.
## The default is to invoke Evince, the GNOME document viewer; Atril (from the
## MATE desktop environment, https://mate-desktop.org/) is used here instead
## since it has a more classic user interface than Evince, though theoretically
## virtually any document viewer, such as Xpdf, can be used.
